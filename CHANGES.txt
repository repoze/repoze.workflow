repoze.workflow Changelog
=========================

0.6.1 (2012-03-24)
------------------

- Repair packaging error (incomplete tarball in 0.6).


0.6 (2012-03-24)
----------------

- When multiple transitions exist between two states, try each transition
  until one succeeds, instead of aborting if the first fails.

- Bumped ``zope.configuration`` dependency to require >= 3.8.0:  the internal
  format of configuration actions changed to dictionaries, rather than tuples,
  and our tests make assertions which rely on the format.

- ``repoze.sphinx.autointerface`` and ``zope.testing`` are only required for
  testing and will no longer be downloaded for ``python setup.py install``;
  use ``python setup.py dev`` to get them installed (along with ``nose`` and
  ``coverage``).

- 100% test coverage

0.5 (2009-08-27)
----------------

- Major overhaul.  Older "statemachine" workflows still work, but are
  deprecated.  Workflow declarations may now be performed via ZCML.
  Documentation overhauled to reflect this fact.

0.4 (2009-06-24)
----------------

- 100% test coverage.

- Allow ``add`` method to accept arbitrary keyword arguments.  These
  keyword arguments are now passed as ``**kw`` to transition functions
  as well as ``before_transition`` and ``after_transition``.  This
  allows arbitrary metadata (such as security and UI information) to
  be associated with a transition.

- The ``transitions`` method now returns all transitions, including
  "catch-all" transitions (transitions with a transition_id of None).

- Add ``transition_info`` method to state machine, which

0.3 (2009-04-10)
----------------

- Removed mutable default arguments, to avoid polluting one state machine's
  states when adding to another.

0.2 (2009-02-20)
----------------

- Initial release. Updated README.txt and removed remnants from repoze
  package template.

0.1
