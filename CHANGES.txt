0.4 (2009-06-24)
----------------

- 100% test coverage.

- Allow ``add`` method to accept arbitrary keyword arguments.  These
  keyword arguments are now passed as ``**kw`` to transition functions

  allows arbitrary metadata (such as security and UI information) to
  be associated with a transition.

- The ``transitions`` method now returns all transitions, including
  "catch-all" transitions (transitions with a transition_id of None).

- Add ``transition_info`` method to state machine, which
